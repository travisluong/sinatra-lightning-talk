%h2 Fly Me To The Moon
%p Fly me to the moon |
<br>Let me play among the stars |
<br>Let me see what spring is like |
<br>On a, Jupiter and Mars |
<br>In other words, hold my hand |
<br>In other words, baby, kiss me |
<br> |
<br>Fill my heart with song |
<br>And let me sing for ever more |
<br>You are all I long for |
<br>All I worship and adore |
<br>In other words, please be true |
<br>In other words, I love you |
<br> |
<br>Fill my heart with song |
<br>Let me sing for ever more |
<br>You are all I long for |
<br>All I worship and adore |
<br>In other words, please be true |
<br>In other words, in other words |
