%p And now, the end is here  |
<br>And so I face the final curtain  |
<br>My friend, I'll say it clear  |
<br>I'll state my case, of which I'm certain  |
<br>I've lived a life that's full  |
<br>I traveled each and ev'ry highway  |
<br>And more, much more than this, I did it my way  |
<br> |
<br>Regrets, I've had a few  |
<br>But then again, too few to mention  |
<br>I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption  |
<br>I planned each charted course, each careful step along the byway  |
<br>And more, much more than this, I did it my way  |
<br> |
<br>Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew  |
<br>When I bit off more than I could chew  |
<br>But through it all, when there was doubt  |
<br>I ate it up and spit it out  |
<br>I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way  |
<br> |
<br>I've loved, I've laughed and cried  |
<br>I've had my fill, my share of losing  |
<br>And now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing  |
<br>To think I did all that  |
<br>And may I say, not in a shy way,  |
<br>"Oh, no, oh, no, not me, I did it my way"  |
<br> |
<br>For what is a man, what has he got?  |
<br>If not himself, then he has naught  |
<br>To say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels  |
<br>The record shows I took the blows and did it my way!  |
<br> |
<br>Yes, it was my way
